# Build-an-AI-Image-Generator-app-using-Imagen-on-Vertex-AI
To successfully run your Vertex AI image generation code in Google Colab, you'll need to follow these steps to set up the environment, enable the necessary API, and ensure proper permissions. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

To use Google Cloud services like **Vertex AI**, you'll need to install the required libraries. Run the following command to install the Google Cloud SDK and Vertex AI SDK:

```python
!pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
```

### Step 2: Authenticate Your Google Cloud Account

Google Colab requires authentication to access your Google Cloud resources. To authenticate, use this command:

```python
from google.colab import auth
auth.authenticate_user()
```

A pop-up will ask you to authenticate your account. Select the Google account associated with your Google Cloud project.

### Step 3: Set Your Project ID

You need to set the project ID for the Google Cloud project where you have Vertex AI enabled. Replace `your-project-id` with your actual project ID:

```bash
!gcloud config set project your-project-id
```

### Step 4: Enable Vertex AI API (If Not Already Enabled)

Vertex AI must be enabled for your Google Cloud project. You can do this in the Colab environment by running:

```bash
!gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

### Step 5: Verify or Set Up Billing Account (If Required)

If you're using your own Google Cloud account, ensure that it has a valid billing account linked to your project. If you're using **Qwiklabs**, make sure that the project is still active, as Qwiklabs projects can expire.

To check the billing status, you can go to the [Google Cloud Billing Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).

### Step 6: Modify the Python Code

Now, adjust your Python code to work in the Colab environment. We will slightly modify the image saving part to display the image in Colab:

```python
import vertexai
from vertexai.preview.vision_models import ImageGenerationModel
from PIL import Image
import io

def generate_image(
    project_id: str, location: str, prompt: str
):
    """Generate an image using a text prompt."""
    
    # Initialize Vertex AI
    vertexai.init(project=project_id, location=location)
    
    # Load the Image Generation model
    model = ImageGenerationModel.from_pretrained("imagegeneration@002")
    
    # Generate the image
    images = model.generate_images(
        prompt=prompt,
        number_of_images=1,
        seed=1,
        add_watermark=False,
    )
    
    # Open the image in Colab
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(images[0].to_bytes()))
    
    # Display the image
    image.show()

    # Save the image to a file
    image.save("output_image.jpeg")

# Now call the function to generate the image
generate_image(
    project_id='your-project-id',  # Replace with your project ID
    location='us-west1',  # Replace with your Google Cloud region
    prompt='Create a picture of the Eiffel Tower in Paris',
)
```

### Step 7: Run the Code

Once everything is set up, run the above code block in Colab. If everything is configured correctly, the image will be generated and displayed directly within the Colab notebook, and it will also be saved as `output_image.jpeg`.

### Step 8: Troubleshooting Common Errors

#### **Error: Permission Denied (403)**
- **Solution**: Ensure that your Google Cloud project has the correct roles. You need to have **Editor** or **Vertex AI User** roles assigned to your account.
- Check that the **Vertex AI API** is enabled by visiting the [API & Services Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis).
- Ensure that your Google Cloud project has a valid **billing account** linked.

#### **Error: Invalid Project or API Not Enabled**
- **Solution**: Make sure you have the correct project ID in your code and the Vertex AI API is enabled. Run:

  ```bash
  !gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
  ```

### Step 9: Viewing and Downloading the Image

If the code runs successfully, you can download the generated image by running the following in Colab:

```python
from google.colab import files
files.download('output_image.jpeg')
```

This will download the `output_image.jpeg` to your local machine.
